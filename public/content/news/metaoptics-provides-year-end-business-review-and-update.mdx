        MetaOptics continues to make progress on continued collaboration with institutional investors, strategic partners, and the broader innovation ecosystem, focusing on deep technology, semiconductor innovation, and global market expansion.

        MetaOptics recently signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with a major camera module manufacturer to produce metalens camera and optical modules, including thin metalens modules for notebook front-facing cameras and laser-based consumer electronics products. MetaOptics also entered into a design agreement with a world-class customer to develop a precision projector metalens, miniaturising their existing optical lens technology.

    <h3 className="font-bold">U.S. Expansion and Technology Development</h3>
    <div className="mdx-text">
        During 2025, MetaOptics strategically expanded to the U.S. through the incorporation of its U.S. subsidiary in October 2025 and the rental of office space through the NUS Block 71 co-working space in San Mateo, strategically located in the heart of Silicon Valley which allowed close engagement with leading semiconductor and smart device companies, and active prospecting of global technology leaders.

    <div className="mdx-text">
        MetaOptics has received positive market interest for its direct laser writer technologies and identified a technology gap in the 200nm–600nm range where MetaOptics' solutions are well positioned to deliver differentiated value. Collaborations with two leading U.S. universities on advanced computational/tunable metalens projects are underway, targeting potential product launches potentially from 2027, alongside recruitment of emerging talent.

    <div className="mdx-text">
        MetaOptics had earlier announced its intention to seek a dual listing of the Company's shares on the NASDAQ Stock Market in the United States (the "<b>Proposed NASDAQ Listing</b>") and will provide updates and release announcements relating to the Proposed NASDAQ Listing (including any material developments and progress made) as may be appropriate from time to time.

    <h3 className="font-bold">Product Launches and Market Outlook</h3>
    <div className="mdx-text">
        MetaOptics' latest device prototypes and Generation-2 products are nearing completion for CES 2026, including participation in Pepcom Premiere.
