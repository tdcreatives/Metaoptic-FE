  Reporting live from the show floor in Las Vegas, she highlighted our breakthrough metalens technology as one of the key announcements of the event. In her coverage, she explored how our nanotech-based lenses are set to redefine consumer electronics—from enabling smartphones with zero camera bumps to powering the next generation of ultra-compact pico projectors and smart glasses.
