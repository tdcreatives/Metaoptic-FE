  We are excited to share that Chua Tian Tian from Money Matters (Money FM 89.3) featured Metaoptics in her coverage of CES 2026.

  Reporting live from the show floor, she highlighted our breakthrough metalens technology as one of the key announcements of the event. In her coverage, she explored how our "glass-on-chip" approach is redefining consumer electronics—enabling the ultra-compact pico projectors and smart glasses she tested at our booth.

  The Bigger Picture: Co-Packaged Optics These consumer demos are just the beginning of the "Semiconductor Optics" vision we shared at CES. By manufacturing lenses like chips, Metaoptics is paving the way for Co-Packaged Optics (CPO)—a future where optical data transmission is embedded directly into semiconductors to power the next generation of AI and data centers.
