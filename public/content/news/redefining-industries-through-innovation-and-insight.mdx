  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our mission is to build a fair healthcare ecosystem that makes cutting-edge science accessible and affordable to everyday healthcare.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  The company was founded from a clinician’s conviction that late diagnosis – especially in oncology – costs lives. With early genomic screening, survival rates can rise dramatically, driving our focus on shifting healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive prevention through early detection and personalised therapeutics.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Alps’ uniqueness lies in its integration and control across verticals. We are not a single lab, but a full ecosystem linking sequencing, manufacturing, clinical capabilities and wellness services. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  This structure ensures quality, speed and translational continuity. Our dual track of innovation and sustainability allows us to pursue frontier research and development (R&D) – from mRNA vaccines to CAR-T and Natural Killer cell therapies – while generating steady revenue through our wellness and medical centres.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  We are expanding across multiple fronts. Alps is preparing for a Nasdaq listing at a valuation of about US$1.6 billion, marking our evolution from regional to global platform. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  In partnership with Johor Land, we are developing BioValley in Johor: a 7,290-acre biotechnology hub with labs, vaccine capacity, incubators and R&D facilities. Through BioValley, we will nurture startups, academic partnerships and talent pipelines, anchoring a sustainable biotech ecosystem.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Early on, we faced funding scarcity and talent gaps, but overcame these by committing company capital to R&D, developing internal training programmes, and forging partnerships with academic and industry experts.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our long-term vision is to position Alps as Asia’s global biotech platform, driving equitable access to advanced therapies and leaving a legacy where science, compassion and scale converge.

  <h3 className="font-bold">Powering a world of zero downtime</h3>
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Groundup.ai turns data into real-time intelligence by helping maintenance teams predict, explain and prevent failures before they happen
  </div>

    <center><small>Leon Lim, founder and CEO of Groundup.ai. PHOTO: GROUNDUP.AI</small></center>
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Groundup.ai equips maintenance teams with real-time intelligence through industrial Internet of Things, proprietary sensors and agentic AI. Our goal is simple yet ambitious: to keep mission-critical equipment running at peak performance with zero downtime, saving clients millions without complex deployments or steep learning curves.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  It all started with a problem. When our founder and CEO Leon Lim ran one of Singapore’s largest blockchain mining operations, frequent overheating and hardware failures caused cascading financial losses.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Waiting for things to break before fixing them clearly was not sustainable. As a musician, Lim was always attuned to subtle changes in tone and pitch. Machines do the same; they “speak” when something’s off. That insight sparked Groundup.ai: a way to listen to machines, detect early signs of failure and act before breakdowns happen.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our uniqueness lies in Cognitive Maintenance. We go beyond predicting failures; our AI explains why a fault will occur, what exactly is wrong and how to fix it. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  It functions like a virtual engineer, learning from operational behaviour and advising teams in real time, reducing false alarms and improving decision-making. By extending asset life and reducing waste, we also help clients advance their sustainability goals.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  We are expanding across Asia and the Middle East, working with clients such as the Republic of Singapore Navy, Wings Group Indonesia, Coca-Cola Bottling Saudi Arabia, Hamad International Airport, and the Doha Metro. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Guided by the Japanese philosophy of san-gen shugi – solving problems from the ground – we are now bringing Cognitive Maintenance to utilities and critical infrastructure, and exploring new markets in Australia, Europe and North Asia.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our vision is a world of zero downtime, where machines self-adjust before faults occur and engineers focus on creation, not crisis. Ultimately, we aim to become the operating system layer for industrial uptime across Asia and the Middle East, transforming maintenance from reaction to foresight.
  </div>
    
  <h3 className="font-bold">Bringing predictive intelligence to everyday healthcare</h3>
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Through its digital-twin platform, Mesh Bio enables clinicians to anticipate chronic disease progression and recommend the next best action
  </div>

  <div className="min-w-80 mdx-text">
    <img className="h-auto mx-auto rounded-lg" src="/news/details/details-11-3.jpeg" />

  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Mesh Bio is a deep-tech digital health startup that develops “digital twins” of patients to help doctors predict disease earlier and personalise care. A digital twin is a data-driven model of how a person’s metabolism and physiology function, allowing us to forecast risks and recommend the next best action, not just react when things go wrong.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our founding team brings together three complementary worlds. Co-founder and CEO Andrew Wu came from diagnostics development, where he saw how earlier insights could drive better clinical decisions. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Arsen Batagov, a former bioinformatics scientist from A*Star, translates biological understanding into clinically actionable algorithms and software, while Dr Melvin Heng, a healthcare leader, understands the realities of care delivery.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Together, we started Mesh Bio to close the gap between “data collected” and “patient outcomes”, beginning with diabetes and kidney disease, which affect millions in Asia.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Most tools look backwards at what has already happened. Our digital-twin platform, HealthVector, looks forward, reconstructing how a patient’s biology is likely to change and highlighting which interventions could alter that path. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  HealthVector Diabetes, approved by the Health Sciences Authority as a medical device, predicts chronic kidney disease in diabetes patients. It has been validated with SingHealth and NHG Health, and published in peer-reviewed journals.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Three things set us apart: a mechanistic foundation that makes predictions transparent; clinical-grade, regulator-approved software; and seamless integration into existing hospital and screening systems.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  We are scaling across South-east Asia and Hong Kong with hospital groups and screening providers, while partnering with life-science companies on kidney-protective and cardio-metabolic therapies. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our vision is a future where every person has a digital twin guiding care from prevention to chronic management, where healthcare shifts from reactive to proactive, and Mesh Bio becomes the trusted operating layer enabling that transformation.

  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  MetaOptics is a vertically integrated semiconductor-optics company pioneering glass-based metalens solutions enhanced by AI-driven image processing. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Using advanced optical design and a scalable 300 mm deep-ultraviolet lithography process, it powers next-generation applications in co-packaged optics, mobile, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR), automotive and other emerging markets.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Headquartered in Singapore, MetaOptics delivers high-performance optics with the reliability and scalability demanded by today’s most innovative technology brands.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Founded on the conviction that optics should be manufactured with the same precision, scalability, and reliability as semiconductors, MetaOptics draws on founder Mark Thng’s two decades of experience in advanced equipment manufacturing and high-volume consumer optics. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Earlier, he helped build sputtering and chemical-polishing systems for a leading US semiconductor equipment company, and later led engineering programmes for optical-sensing modules used in flagship consumer devices.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  These experiences revealed a clear gap: While electronics advanced rapidly, optics remained constrained by legacy glass-grinding and plastic-moulding methods. Thng saw the opportunity to merge semiconductor-grade processes with AI-driven optical design, creating optics that could scale with modern electronics. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  That vision led to MetaOptics, built to pioneer the next generation of wafer-level metalens solutions.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  MetaOptics develops glass-based metalenses that are thinner, lighter and more heat-resistant than conventional lenses. Using semiconductor fabrication, we produce lenses on both 100 mm and 300 mm wafer formats to support high-mix prototyping and mass production. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our AI imaging algorithms further enhance optical performance over time.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  We are expanding into AR/VR, automotive sensing and data-centre optics, partnering with system integrators, foundries and research institutes. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our long-term vision is to establish MetaOptics as a global leader in glass-based metalens technology, and anchor a next-generation optics ecosystem in Singapore serving markets worldwide.
  </div>
  
  <h3 className="font-bold">Mapping the future of real estate with geospatial intelligence</h3>
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Mogul turns location data into smart property tools that enhance transparency and efficiency across real estate
  </div>

  <div className="min-w-80 mdx-text">
    <img className="h-auto mx-auto rounded-lg" src="/news/details/details-11-5.jpg" />
    <center><small>Gerald Sim, co-founder and CEO of Mogul.sg. PHOTO: MOGUL.SG</small></center>
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Mogul is a geospatial company that collects data associated with specific locations and builds them into maps. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  We apply this data to property-industry solutions, from multiple-keyword searches that help users find properties with greater ease and speed, to automated valuation models that factor in geographical attributes such as proximity to parks, floor level or nearby major roads. We also offer 3D visualisations of properties that simulate sun-shadow patterns at different times of the day, giving users a fuller understanding of a property’s surroundings.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  The idea came when co-foun  der and CEO Gerald Sim was searching for properties and realised that most platforms were like Yellow Pages: basic listings with limited insight.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Missing or inaccurate geographical information often surfaced only after visiting the site. Sim thought: Why not provide richer data so users can make better decisions before viewing?
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  After launching the multiple-keyword search, we extended our solutions to improve productivity across the property-transaction value chain. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our automated valuation model incorporates geographical attributes for more accurate assessments than traditional comparisons of past transactions. This has helped banks achieve faster, more cost-effective property valuations, marking our pivot into the B2B sector.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our goal is to enhance productivity in real estate by providing data-driven tools that make searches and valuations more efficient, reduce bias, and pave the way for fully automated transactions, supporting Singapore’s Smart Nation vision. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our 3D map also allows developers to integrate unbuilt projects into existing environments, potentially replacing physical showroom models and promoting sustainability.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Having begun in the B2C space, we are now expanding B2B operations in Thailand and Vietnam, with subscription-based models for banks and regional partnerships. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our long-term vision is to pioneer a fully digital, automated and regionally scalable real-estate ecosystem.

  <h3 className="font-bold">Helping Singaporeans live well, without pain</h3>
  <div className="mdx-text">
  The Health Collective integrates chiropractic, osteopathy, physiotherapy and dental care to relieve pain and promote lasting well-being
  </div>

  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  The Health Collective is a group of healthcare clinics in Singapore offering chiropractic, osteopathy, physiotherapy and dental care under one umbrella.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Our journey began in 2018, when our co-owner, Amelia Lee, returned from Harvard Business School, where she was introduced to entrepreneurship through acquisition: taking over small and medium-sized enterprises with no succession plans. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Together, Lee and co-founder Aileen Seah began searching full-time for a business to buy. During this search, we came across Chiropractic Singapore, a small chain whose founder was looking to exit. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  At the time, Seah was in the late stages of pregnancy and experiencing aches and pains. After trying chiropractic care and feeling real improvement, we became convinced of its value and potential.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  We acquired Chiropractic Singapore in 2019. A year later, our friend Goh Xin Ying, who had lived with scoliosis, joined us, and in 2021 we expanded further with City Osteopathy & Physiotherapy and WeSmile Dental Care. We wanted to build businesses that last and serve a greater good. Coming from corporate and government backgrounds, we believed traditional businesses could be run better, with more heart, purpose and alignment between people and performance. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  We also saw how many Singaporeans quietly live with chronic pain that’s often dismissed amid daily life. We wanted to create awareness that pain is not “normal”, and that with the right care, people can truly live well.
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  What sets The Health Collective apart is our integrated, patient-first approach. We run all core functions – marketing, operations, partnerships and technology – in-house, allowing clinicians to focus fully on care. 
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Across our network, chiropractors, osteopaths, physiotherapists and dentists collaborate seamlessly, emphasising posture, spinal health, movement and preventive care to help patients build long-term well-being.
