  Key highlights from the coverage include:
  <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
    <li class="pl-5">The Pico Projector Demo: A live test of our ultra-portable projector that requires no manual focusing.</li>
    <li class="pl-5">Mass Scalability: How our manufacturing process allows for rapid scalability similar to microchips.</li>
    <li class="pl-5">Future Applications: A look ahead at how our metalens technology will impact everything from AR/VR glasses to data center efficiency.</li>
  </ul>
