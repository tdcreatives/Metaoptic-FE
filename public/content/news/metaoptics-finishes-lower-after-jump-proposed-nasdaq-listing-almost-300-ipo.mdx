  [SINGAPORE] Shares of semiconductor optics company MetaOptics rose as much as 5.5 per cent in early trading after the market opened on Thursday (Nov 27). 
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  The counter was at S$0.77 around 9.07 am, but had eased to about S$0.75 at the end of the morning session. It closed the day at S$0.705, 3.4 per cent down.

  <div className="mdx-text">
    The company launched its initial public offering (IPO) at S$0.20 a share and <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/metaoptics-closes-20-ipo-price-catalist-trading-debut" target="_blank"><u>started trading in Singapore in early September</u></a>; the price has soared almost 300 per cent since then.

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Last week, the firm, which says it pioneered glass-based metalens solutions enhanced by artificial intelligence-driven image processing, announced plans for a dual listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange in the US. 
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  In a filing on Nov 17, MetaOptics said the proposed Nasdaq listing will enable it to gain access to a diversified pool of investors and improve the trading liquidity of its securities.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “The board further believes that the proposed Nasdaq listing presents an excellent opportunity to enable the group to build up its metalens design and fabrication capabilities in the US.”
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  It added that a US listing would bring the group close to its potential key customers, “to support the advancement of next-generation optical technologies across several sectors”.
  </div> 
  
  <div className="mdx-text">
  MetaOptics also announced that it established a fully owned US subsidiary in late October, which it said was to advance next-generation optical technologies and “strengthen cross-border collaborations” in semiconductor manufacturing, integrated photonics and nanophotonics.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  At the time, the company’s executive chairman and CEO Mark Thng said setting up the US subsidiary “reflects our dedication to scaling cutting-edge optical technologies for global markets, with the US as a strategic growth base”. 
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “Our new advances in co-packaged optics and collaborations with world-class US institutions demonstrate our resolve to innovate and drive value for customers in the semiconductor and photonics markets,” he added.

  <h3 className="font-bold">Market cap below SGX-Nasdaq bridge’s S$2 billion requirement</h3>
  <div className="mdx-text">
  The announcement of a planned Nasdaq listing was before the Singapore Exchange (SGX) announced the <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/tech-unicorns-set-benefit-new-sgx-nasdaq-dual-listing-highway-observers" target="_blank"><u>SGX-Nasdaq dual-listing bridge</u></a> the same week. 
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Scheduled to go live around mid-2026, the framework enables companies with a market capitalisation of S$2 billion and above to pursue a dual listing on both Nasdaq and SGX through a single set of documents and a simplified review process.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  But the S$2 billion market cap requirement means that MetaOptics is ineligible for a dual listing through the framework. As at Nov 27, its market cap stood at S$172.25 million.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  The bridge is also meant to drive liquidity by enabling continuous trading across time zones. 
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  However, investors are somewhat limited by its boundaries – they will only be able to trade Singapore and US securities that apply to be dual-listed under the framework.
