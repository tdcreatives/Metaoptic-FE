        MetaOptics Ltd (Catalist: 9MT) ("MetaOptics" or the "Company", and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group"), a leading-edge semiconductor optics company, announced that it is proposing to raise S$4.85 million through a placement of 6,685,028 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company ("Placement Shares") at S$0.7255 per Placement Share ("Share Placement").

    <div className="mdx-text">
        The proceeds from the Share Placement are expected to (i) strengthen the Group's financial position and expand the capital base of the Group to support the fulfilment of an anticipated growing pipeline of global customer purchase orders, and (ii) provide liquidity and funding to provide for the Group's general working capital requirements.
    </div>
    
    <div className="mdx-text">
        The proceeds from the Share Placement will reinforce working capital, enhance supply-chain readiness and accelerate MetaOptics' scaling plans for its glass-based metalens solutions as demand rises across consumer devices, automotive systems and emerging industrial applications.
    </div>
    
    <div className="mdx-text">
        The participating investors in the Share Placement comprise new investors and existing shareholders of the Company, who have been following the Company's technology progress and commercial developments since the Company's listing on the Catalist board of the SGX-ST in September 2025. Their participation reflects increasing global interest in metalens technology as companies seek thinner, lighter and more power-efficient optical systems that can be manufactured at scale.
