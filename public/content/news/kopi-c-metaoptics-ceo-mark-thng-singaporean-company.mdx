  MetaOptics CEO Mark Thng shares how they are using semiconductor technology to create flat, glass-based metalenses to create everything from non-contact fingerprint scanners to optical AI chips.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Mobile phones get thinner, sleeker, and lighter every few years. Yet no matter how slim the design, one feature remains, seemingly impossible for manufacturers to smooth away: the awkward camera “bump”.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  These protruding lenses are a physical reminder of the limits of existing injection moulded polymer optical engineering. 
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  MetaOptics, a Singapore-based semiconductor optics company, wants to change this. Its team is developing metalenses—flat, glass-based lenses built and fabricated using the same technology and manufacturing process as semiconductor chips. 
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Unlike conventional polymer lenses that warp under heat, MetaOptics’ lenses are fabricated on glass, making them both smaller and more heat-resistant. The result is an optical module that’s just two millimetres thick, with an actual metalens thickness of 0.775mm, capable of sitting flush against a phone’s back while still featuring reasonable performance.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  MetaOptics CEO Mark Thng highlights this, calling out how brands publicise thinness without mentioning the protruding camera. “We are hoping to solve this,” he says. At the same time, the company’s ambitions go far beyond fixing a camera bump.
  </div>



  <h3 className="font-bold">Beyond the bump: a lens that thinks like a chip</h3>
  <div className="mdx-text">
  To understand MetaOptics' business, one must first understand its technology.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Firstly, MetaOptics’ lenses sound more like chips than optical parts precisely because they are. Instead of using curved glass, the company uses semiconductor photolithography processes to directly etch millions of microscopic pillars on a flat wafer—similar to how transistors are etched onto silicon. The smallest features measure 80 nanometres, one-thousandth the width of a human hair.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Secondly, this manufacturing method allows their lenses to potentially possess a unique quality: they can behave like programmable optical surfaces.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “Because metalens is dielectric in nature, we actually can put certain voltage to the lens and the reflective index will change,” Thng explains.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  In practice, that means one lens can adapt to perform multiple roles—zooming, focusing, or shifting depth—without the need for multiple cameras.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “We call the camera that we produce a computational camera,” he says. “We can actually change it to do certain things.”
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Instead of five fixed lenses doing separate jobs, Thng envisions a single, tuneable one. The result could reduce cost, save space, and make devices slimmer than ever.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “People are used to comparing apples to oranges,” he adds with a grin. “For us, we’re not trying to compete in cost. We’re trying to jump way ahead to breakthrough existing optics technologies and miniaturizing smart devices with our thin metalenses.”
  </div>

  <h3 className="font-bold">From phones to fingerprints and AI chips</h3>
  <div className="mdx-text">
  While smartphones are the most visible frontier, MetaOptics’ technology has broader implications. One of its most intriguing applications lies in 3D biometrics.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  In today’s airports, banks, homes and offices, fingerprint scanners still require a firm press against a glass panel. For Thng, this is a process that’s both unhygienic and insecure.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “Those devices are not guaranteed,” he explains. “Security is low… if you are a private investigator, you will find that I can copy your fingerprint because you leave your fingerprint there.”
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  His team’s solution is a non-contact 3D fingerprint scanner that uses light to map prints without physical touch. “To avoid all those touching panels,” he shares, “I said okay, let me make it non-contact, and we were able to do it.”
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  The company is now working with universities in Hong Kong and Korea-based fingerprint device companies to explore the possibility of integrating the technology into ATM machines as well as 3D Biometrics sensors, particularly for elderly users who struggle with PIN codes or forget their cards.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  MetaOptics is also pushing into AI hardware, an area few optics companies dare to enter. By embedding metalenses directly into chip packaging—a process known as Co-Packaged Optics (CPO)—MetaOptics can replace copper wiring with light-based data transmission.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “We use light to transmit, so you can eliminatethe use of copper, and go into light-based transmission,” Thng explains. “Then the chip will be smaller, emit less heat, and cost less because you’ve got less circuitry inside.”
  </div>

  <h3 className="font-bold">The lean entrepreneur behind the lens</h3>
  <div className="mdx-text">
  Unlike many other start-ups, MetaOptics’ story began with its founder’s retirement.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “I retired in 2018. Financially, I’m free,” says Thng. “I became a consultant to some companies that were made up of founders who are very young… I saw VCs investing in them, but for many, the money just goes to waste.”
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Those experiences convinced him that there was a better way to build deep-tech businesses. His philosophy: stay lean, stay disciplined, and always focus on the return to shareholders.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  MetaOptics began its initial foray into the industry as an equipment maker, developing and producing compact laser writers for research labs. Those early machines funded the company’s R&D and proved that its technology could move from lab to market.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Today, the company designs and fabricates its own metalenses and imaging modules, including a portable projector that plugs directly into smartphones. “It takes power from an iPhone or Android phone,” he says. “[It’s bright enough that] I use it to watch movies when I’m lying on my bed at night.”
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Even the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) ordered one after a visit. “They came here, they interviewed us, then the lady went back to Geneva and then she went to our Shopify and ordered. So we shipped it to her.”
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  MetaOptics remains small but nimble. For FY2024, the company reported revenue of S$79,440 and a net loss of about S$2.3 million. In the first quarter of FY2025, net loss was approximately S$706,000.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  When the time came to raise capital, Thng chose to list locally in Singapore. 
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  For Thng, the decision to list at home carried both strategic and sentimental weight. “I see many people going overseas … and I saw the industry and the landscape of our stock exchange not doing very well. So I thought maybe we can try to contribute at least.”
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  The listing—30 million shares at S$0.20 each—raised S$6.0 million in gross proceeds (about S$4.0 million net of expenses) on SGX’s Catalist board in September 2025, giving MetaOptics the credibility to compete globally.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  At its debut, the company was valued at roughly S$47 million, with shares surging 25 per cent on the first day of trading. By early October 2025, MetaOptics’ market capitalisation has more than doubled to over S$110 million.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Thng says the listing also underscores how far SGX can reach. The Catalist debut drew strong interest from both institutional and retail investors, as well as several based overseas. Among them was Miss Yvonne Zhao Yi Qing, a Singapore-based foreign investor who runs her own investment firm and participated in the fund-raising.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “It’s heartening to see international investors take notice of what we’re building here,” he says. “We’re very grateful for their confidence, and we hope to keep creating value as we grow.”
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  For him, this is an encouraging sign that SGX’s platform can give even young deep-tech companies with the right set-up and ambitions global visibility. 
  </div>

  <h3 className="font-bold">Running fast, staying grounded</h3>
  <div className="mdx-text">
  For a man who started his company post-retirement, Thng sounds like someone just getting started.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “We believe we will be a unicorn,” he says, matter-of-factly. “Based on the technology and our sensing of the market, I think we are running as fast as we can. I think we are way ahead of everyone.”
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Yet he’s also candid about the challenges of building deep-tech ventures in Singapore. His hope is that MetaOptics’ success might change that. 
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “After MetaOptics’ success, [VCs and investors] can pay more attention to Singapore, and to entrepreneurs wanting to list on SGX. Maybe they can be more supportive of us,” he says.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  Despite some frustrations, Thng remains hopeful. 
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  “We have a few thousand PhDs just across the road at our National Institute & universities. We have many wonderful technologies,” he says. “If two thousand PhDs can spin off, that’s two thousand Catalist companies possibly listing.”
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
  It’s a fitting vision for a company that started with the simple vision of flattening a camera lens.
  </div>
